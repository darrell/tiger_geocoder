correctly handle addreses like '1234 1/2 Main St'. Right now, we have
nowhere to keep the 1/2.
--
Add the ability to limit the search to within a passed geometry.

--
Address normalization would work better if we had an exhaustive
list of possible values in the pre* and suf* fields of featnames
--
if we are already loading a file, say, cousub from the state level,
we should not append the county level equivalent files.
---
It would be nice if we could find a good way to supress
shp2pgsql's need to spit out lines like:
  Shapefile type: Point
  Postgis type: POINT[2]

The following should be equivalent, can we match them?:

3244 Highway 116 N, Sebastopol, CA, 95472
3244 Gravenstein Highway N, Sebastopol, CA 95472

Why do we have different addys for:

select * from geocode('3244 Gravenstein Highway,  Sebastopol, CA 95472');
select * from normalize_address('3244 Gravenstein Highway, Sebastopol, CA 95472');

Remove all deprecated tables and views.

---
Create a series of test addresses to verify against.

from normalize_address.sql:
  -- FIXME: in the case where we have just
  -- a street and zip (e.g. 123 Something, 12345), and
  -- there happens to be a place named 'Something' in that state,
  -- we will not match the street because we think it's a place. 
  -- I'm not sure a good way to work
  -- around this.
  AND
  -- FIXME: we should have a lookup table like
  -- direction and street_types appropriate to the suffixes
  -- sufqual as prequal above.

address_variants() should be more thoughtful about ranking
an address based on the number of (mis-)matched elements.

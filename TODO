I'm not sure yet what needs to be done as far as merging
the imported files, creating views, etc. As such,
the merge function is almost certainly incomplete.

It would be nice if we could find a good way to supress
shp2pgsql's need to spit out lines like:
  Shapefile type: Point
  Postgis type: POINT[2]
